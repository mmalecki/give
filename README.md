`give` ('git-versioned environment', name courtesy of [@AvianFlu](https://github.com/AvianFlu)) is a git-based node.js version manager.

It allows you to install anything git can checkout:

  * tags: `give install v0.6.10`
  * commits: `give install 3f43b1c039727e12c7a27fb31010aa309a4a35d8`
  * branches: `give install master`

It's also very fast - instead of doing `git checkout` it uses `git archive`
which is very fast on local repositories.

## Installation

    npm install -g give
